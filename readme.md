# Animated-Demo-of-Kruskal-Algorithm

------

The function of this project is to complete the animation of the minimum spanning tree algorithm named Kruskal including the random generation graph and the calculation process of the Krusal algorithm. The programming language is C#. Because it is completed in my sophomore year, the code is relatively immature.
